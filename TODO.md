1. Read plain text files with description
2. display map and let user move and zoom on it
3. when closing, stop audio
4. Fix issue on browsing that mapa-sonoro.html is twice on the browsing history / avoid leaving a hash at the end fo the URL
5. drop places when page is loaded
6. Think in a fast way of adding html places (take location coordinates into account)
